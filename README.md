# React Weather Application ðŸŒ¤

This is my first every React project! I created a Weather Application connected to [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)! 

The application provides you with current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather description, complete with associated icons!
The application also provides you with 6-day forecast!

I used icons from [here](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons).

The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://kcodes-weather-app-react.netlify.app/) -> Give it a try!
